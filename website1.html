<h2>Main plotline:</h2>
A pair of twin siblings are sent to their uncle's place in a town in Oregon called Gravity Falls for the summer. During their stay, they come across all sorts of strange and fascinating creatures, anomalies, and mysteries.

<h2>Characters: Dipper Pines<h2>

<p>Curious, daring, and paranoid are three words I would use to describe Dipper’s overall demeanor. This 12 year old boy and brother to Mabel has a fascination for the supernatural, especially since the day he found a journal in the woods that contains research of supernatural phenomena. Most importantly, he is deeply bonded to Mabel and will always be by her side, no matter what.</p>


<h2>Characters: Mabel Pines<h2>

<p>Mabel is the twin sister to Dipper of the same age, going about her summer with a generally optimistic and bubbly personality. She has a passion for art (crafting), love, and her pig, Waddles, but she is willing to come along with Dipper during his exploration of Gravity Falls weirdness as well. Despite the differences between the siblings, Mabel also cares for Dipper and the two have a very healthy sibling dynamic.</p>

<h2>Characters: Stan Pines<h2>
<img src="https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/gravity-falls-mystery-shack.jpg" widith="400" height="400"/>
<p>Stan (or Grunkle Stan by the Pines twins) is the uncle to Dipper and Mabel, as well as the owner of a tourist trap called the Mystery Shack (which is also where Dipper & Mabel stayed for the summer). The place sells merchandise and souvenirs of mystery/wacky themes, most of which are made up urban legends. Stan may be a con-man with a high record of crime (mainly theft & fraud), but he also has a good heart and does things for the benefit of family.</p>
